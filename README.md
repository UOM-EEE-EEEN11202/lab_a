This is a dummy repository left over due to how GitHub classroom works. It is set as a template, so GitHub classroom can then copy it. It's not then actually used though. I'm not deleting in case it breaks anything and so that the naming of things stays consistent as more labs are made.

Anyway, basically ignore this repository. Starter files go in uom-...-lab_a not here.
